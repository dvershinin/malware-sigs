# magento1-core-observer

This Magento 1 specific malware allows its user to make destructive things like dropping specific tables,
or the database in general, and likewise, specific folder or the whole website folder.

Was clearly implanted by a developer working for the website previously, as the path to the actual website directory,
and database name, were hardcoded.

Since this is Magento 1 specific, it was not detected by any scanners.

**This was discovered only when scanning for hardcoded website path `/var/www/html` in preparation for moving 
to another hosting, where the new path is different.**

Haven't been used in years, so likely was the means for "countermeasures" by developer against the website owner.
